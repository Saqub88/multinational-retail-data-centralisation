# Multinational retail data cetralisation.

This has been an eventful adventure of mixing both old and new skills. Previously learnt skill included the use of python and OOP while also implementing newly learnt skills with pandas, some sql, use of boto3, sqlalchemy etc, data cleaning etc. 
First steps are often the hardest but as the tasks went on, things began to get easier as some aspects repeated themselves. 


    # has worked although confusing as to how to use raw table data. (eg join date? users joined under 1 years age. makes sense if they sell baby toys. not so much if a casino)
    # when running there are a few mentions of the lines returning views as opposed to copies of the data.
    # need to work on indexes. setting index to index column and also renumbering the rows so they run in sequence.
